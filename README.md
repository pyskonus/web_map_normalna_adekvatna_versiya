web_map
=======

This module creates a html file that generates a map.
The map shows the population of each country and shows the films and series that have been shot in a particular year.
The web_map module requires user to input the year that he is interested to observe.
The input is provided by the console.
You can find the map (html file) in the folder where web_map module is.
The program requires a lot of time due to geocoding, but each time it gets new coordinates, it adds them to a file, so
with time the runtime will get smaller.

file_analysis
=============

This module helps split the code into two parts what makes the program easier to understand.



<body></body>	Declares the description of the part that is visible to the user.
<head></head>	This part of code doesn't create anythong visible on the page.
<script></script>   Can contain a reference to a different program.
<link></link>   Establishes a link to some other document.
<style></style> Describes the style of some elements on the page.



The map shows how the cinematography evolved. And how the ratio
between the amount of folms and amount of series changed over time.
